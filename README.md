# tasspad
A system tray to-do list for making quick notes, which can be organized later into groups and shortcuts if they become a project. Notes can be assigned icons and execute commands, so Tasspad could also be used as a program launcher. It is highly customizable and capable of being translated.

left-click to remove a note you've added, right click to make that note more complicated

written for Python 3.4+ and Gtk+ 3.
